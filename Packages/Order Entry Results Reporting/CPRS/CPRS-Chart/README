The CPRSv29 source on the FOIA site:

   https://downloads.va.gov/files/FOIA/Software/Patches_By_Application/CPRS%20GUI%20FILES/CPRS%20VERSION%2029/OR_30_306_SRC_scrubbed.zip

contained three files that was released under the 1.1 version of the
Mozilla Public license:

  "Wcrypt2.pas", "WinSCard.pas", and "XlfMime.pas".

The license for these files is not compatible with the license of this
repository and cannot be distributed within it.  These files have been
separated into a different repository and will need to be acquired by
either downloading or cloning from:

   https://github.com/OSEHRA-Sandbox/CPRSv29-XUDigSig

or by recreating the files locally.

The CMake variable "BUILD_DELPHI_XuDigSig_DIR" should be set to the folder
that contains these files to build correctly.
